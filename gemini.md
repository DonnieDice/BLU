# 🤖 AI Agent: Gemini for BLU

This document provides guidance for the Gemini AI agent when working with the BLU repository.

## 🚀 Project Overview

BLU (Better Level-Up!) is a World of Warcraft addon that replaces default sounds with iconic audio from 50+ games. The project is currently in `v6.0.0-alpha` and has undergone a complete professional reorganization.

**Key Points:**
- **Target**: Retail WoW (The War Within 11.0.5)
- **Framework**: Custom lightweight, modular, event-driven framework.
- **Dependencies**: No external library dependencies.
- **Branding**: RGX Mods (RealmGX Community Project)
- **Testing**: A directory junction is in place for automatic in-game testing.

## 🎯 My Purpose

My primary purpose is to assist with code quality, architecture, and best practices for the BLU addon. I am one of three specialized AI agents used in this project, and my role is defined as the **`code-reviewer`**.

My expertise, as configured in `.claude-code-router/agents/code-reviewer.json`, includes:
- Code quality, security, and best practices
- Architectural and design pattern review
- Error handling and edge case analysis
- WoW API usage validation
- Performance and maintainability assessment

## 🛠️ My Capabilities

*   **Code Analysis:** I can analyze the codebase to understand file structure, symbol relationships, and adherence to best practices.
*   **File Operations:** I can read, write, and modify files within the project.
*   **Shell Commands:** I can execute shell commands for tasks like searching, listing files, and running scripts.
*   **Project Information:** I can provide information about the project based on its files.

## 🤖 AI Assistant Integration

This project uses `claude-code-router` to delegate tasks to specialized AI models:
- **`wow-ui-expert` (GPT-4o)**: For UI/UX design and implementation.
- **`lua-optimizer` (Deepseek)**: For performance and memory optimization.
- **`code-reviewer` (Gemini)**: For code quality, architecture, and security reviews.

I can be invoked directly with the `gemini` command or automatically when keywords like `review`, `quality`, `bug`, `security`, or `architecture` are used.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Loading Order**: `BLU.toc` -> `blu.xml` -> Core Systems -> Localization -> Interface -> Feature Modules.
- **Core Systems**: `core.lua` (main framework), `database.lua`, `config.lua`, `registry.lua` (sound system), `loader.lua`.
- **Modules**: Feature modules (e.g., `levelup`, `quest`) are loaded on-demand based on user settings to optimize performance.
- **Design**: The addon uses a custom lightweight framework that mimics some Ace3 API patterns for potential future migration.

## 📝 Common Development Tasks

### Testing the Addon
A directory junction is in place, syncing changes to the WoW AddOns folder automatically. Any file change is available in-game after a `/reload`.
`C:\Users\Joey\BLU` -> `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\BLU`

### Adding a New Feature Module
1.  Create `modules/NewFeature/NewFeature.lua`.
2.  Implement the module structure:
    ```lua
    local module = BLU:NewModule("NewFeature")
    function module:Init() ... end
    function module:Cleanup() ... end
    ```
3.  Add the new Lua file to `blu.xml` to be loaded.

### Git Workflow
- **`main`**: Stable releases.
- **`alpha`**: Active development.
- Commits should be made as the repository owner. Do not add AI assistants as co-authors.

## 📜 Important Conventions

### Naming Conventions (STRICT)
- **ALL directories**: MUST be `lowercase`.
- **ALL Lua and XML files**: MUST be `lowercase`.
- **EXCEPTIONS**:
  - `BLU.toc` MUST be `UPPERCASE`.
- **Addon Name in Code**: `BLU` (uppercase).
- **Author**: `donniedice`
- **Email**: `donniedice@protonmail.com`

*Reasoning: Windows is case-insensitive, but WoW's Lua environment is case-sensitive. All paths in XML and Lua must match the exact case on the file system to prevent issues.*

### Sound File Structure
- Sound files are consolidated. No more `_high`, `_med`, `_low` variants in filenames. Volume is handled by the addon's settings.
- Format: `gamename_soundtype.ogg`.

### Localization
- Use `BLU:Loc(key, ...)` for all user-facing strings.
- All localizations are stored in `localization/`.
